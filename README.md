# platitudes

Eventually - A random text generator with randomly generated soundscapes.

Soundscapes will be randomly generated using howlerjs sprite definition and simple logic.

nouns, modals and truism/negisms will be updated as time permits.

This project is comprised of the following personal development goals:

- Learn how to utilize npm to install and begin working with a module (howler)  // complete
- Learn git:
  1) basic git functionality of branching and merging                          //complete
  2) connect git to vscode for better workflow                                 //WIP
- learn how to host a simple website                                           //still need to read docs
- Learn css and stylize the page, specifically:
  1) event on scroll to advance message                                        //still need to read docs
  2) simple 2 dimmensional spinning mandalla to generate random platitude      //still need to read docs
  3) audio start stop icon                                                     //still need to read docs

stretch goal:

store nouns, modals, truism/negisms in csv and read on script                 

stretchier goal:

tweet your platitude as a video with captured sound
